## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to Inertia4J with code, please signal you'd like to work on a feature by **commenting on an
issue**. After that, you can fork the Inertia4J repository, develop your feature/fix and then open a Pull Request,
**linking the issue** that it relates to. Avoid opening PRs without any related issue, and when selecting an issue to
solve, try to always communicate that you are working on it, in order to avoid two people working on the same thing.

If you come across any doubts regarding the library's inner workings when developing, you can always ask for help in the
issue you're working on.
